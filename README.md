# CodingSuccess
This is My Final Project For Code to Success.
I'm doing a coding program and this is my final project. I'm really proud of it. I had to upload it to gitHub to turn it in.
* It looks/works the best if it's the size of a MacBook Air Standard Chrome Window. To preserve the styles, it stops growing/shrinking after a certain point.
* Ok the CSS should be updated so the buttons to the far right look like they're supposed to now. 

I hope you like it! 
Thanks!
